Subject: [PATCH 1/3] clutter/stage: Add an API for shallow relayouts

Where "shallow" means you can specify any actor instead of every relayout
having to start from the stage.

Subject: [PATCH 2/3] window-group: Set flag CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT

Because windows are either free-floating or manually positioned. So
their size and position does not affect that of the group or its
ancestors.

This doesn't yet provide a performance benefit but it soon will in
subsequent commits to optimize `CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT`.

Subject: [PATCH 3/3] clutter/actor: Use the new shallow relayout API

If an actor sets flag `CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT` then that means it
is (or should be) unaffected by `queue_relayout` calls in its children.
So we can avoid propagating `queue_relayout` all the way up to the stage
and avoid a full stage relayout each time.

But those children whose parent has `CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT` still need
to be allocated at some point. So we do it at the same point where it
happened before. Only we now queue a *shallow* relayout so the `allocate`
run on the next frame doesn't need to descend the whole actor tree anymore.
Only a subtree and hopefully very small.

For free-floating and top-level actors this provides a measurable
performance benefit. According to Google Profiler, calls to
`_clutter_stage_maybe_relayout` are now so cheap that they no longer show
up in performance profiles. Overall gnome-shell's CPU usage is reduced
by relative amounts:

  * Dragging windows with the mouse: -10.0%
  * Drag-and-drop an icon in the overview: -4.0%
  * Icon spring animation: -7.7%
